## Coding To Learn

Inspired by my initial overwhelming feeling of trying to learn how to code and being unsure of where to start, this application is made to focus all relevant resources for learning coding languages, or good free online options for people trying to learn coding for the first time.

## How It's Made: Tech used: Next, TypeScript, React, JavaScript, CSS

With only having two weeks to push an application into production, I had to build this application with MVP in mind and tried to build it as simple as possible first, and then started adding more convenient features for the users to navigate the site.  Using <a href = "https://www.figma.com/file/mScZr16E3OULjFtyMNmQNl/2-Week-project?type=design&node-id=1-62&mode=design&t=DCyALd5Gby33NYWt-0">Figma</a>, I was able to draft the initial design that I wanted to aim for this application and build upon from there.  Building customized React components, I was able to streamline the process of creating the language pages and the intro classes pages.  Using a combination of React and Zustand states, I was able to update the search results and the search suggestions dynamically as the user typed in the search bar.  Using a bit of React state and CSS, I was able to manipulate the hamburger menu in the mobile view; however the behaviour is not the effect I was going for unfortunately for desktop.

## Optimizations:

I definitely want to work on the styling more for all the pages for this application, the design for this page on mobile and desktop could be improved upon.  By storing a static list of all the sites current content as data into my code locally, I was able to easily access and manipulate that data with the search bar and the search suggestions functionalities without having to worry about server errors or cors being blocked.

## Lessons Learned:

I should have planned out my project tasks better, there were certain tasks like creating the Language page component that took longer than intended, but other tasks like actually implementing the Language pages using the Language page component that didn't take as long as I thought it would.  Time management was definitely a struggle for me, 2 weeks was a difficult timeline for me to envision how I wanted to approach building this project.  Below, you can see the daily progress I made with building this application through my LinkedIn posts.
